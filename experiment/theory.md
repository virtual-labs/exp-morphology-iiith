### Morph Analyser


#### Definition

Morphemes are considered as smallest meaningful units of language. These morphemes can either be a root word(play) or affix(-ed). Combination of these morphemes is called morphological process. So, word "played" is made out of 2 morphemes "play" and "-ed". Thus finding all parts of a word(morphemes) and thus describing properties of a word is called "Morphological Analysis". For example, "played" has information verb "play" and "past tense", so given word is past tense form of verb "play".
